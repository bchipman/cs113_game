### Introduction

**Overview:** This is the game my team and I created for CS113 at UC Irvine in Fall 2014.  Famished tournament is a 2D player vs player, arena-style fighting game with music, sound, pixel-based graphics and sprites, and player control achieved via USB gamepad.

**Description:** Two players gain levels and customizable skills as the game progresses in order to enhance their chances of winning. Both players begin at level 1 and with no skills. NPCs spawn in fixed time intervals. The last player to hit a NPC (killing blow) before its death is granted experience points to level up. In addition, NPCs drop skills upon death. Regardless of who landed the kill blow, any player can pick up the dropped skill. The objective of the game is to kill the enemy player.

**Background Story:** Under the tyranny of the dark overlord, the world is in chaos and all the resources are nearly depleted.  Entire populations have been subjugated to life in labor camps, brutally policed by the overlord's military forces.  As your people's champion, you must fight to the death in the battle arena to win much needed resources.
